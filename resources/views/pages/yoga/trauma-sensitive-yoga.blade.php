                <p class="mt-3">“Trauma is much more than a story about something that happened long ago. The emotions and
                    physical sensations that were imprinted during the trauma are experienced not as memories but as
                    disruptive physical reactions in the present...The engines of posttraumatic reactions are located in the
                    emotional brain. In contrast with the rational brain, which expresses itself in thoughts, the emotional
                    brain manifests itself in physical reactions. The fundamental issue in resolving traumatic stress is to
                    restore the proper balance between the rational and emotional brains. Neuroscience research shows that
                    the only way we can change the way we feel is by becoming aware of our inner experience and learning to
                    befriend what is going on inside ourselves."
                </p>
                <p>
                    – Bessel van der Kolk, Founder and Medical Director of the Trauma Centre at Justice Resource Institute
                    in his book, The Body Keeps the Score. –
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Bessel van der Kolk describes in his quote, emotional pain and traumatic memories can be held in the
                    body long after a traumatic experience has occurred. For some of us, it can feel like the trauma is
                    remembered much less in words and more so with feelings that occur in the body. These bodily sensations
                    associated with trauma can overwhelm the nervous system and our coping skills, which can result in a
                    profound and lasting sense of vulnerability and a lack of safety and control. As Bessel van der Kolk
                    aptly describes it… “the body keeps the score”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leading trauma theorists recognize that because trauma profoundly affects the body and many symptoms are
                    somatically based, trauma treatment must incorporate the body. Neuroscience informs us that there is a
                    part of the brain called the insula, which transmits our physical, bodily sensations into our conscious
                    awareness. Brain imaging studies repeatedly show a marked decrease in activation of the insula, and
                    other parts of the brain that are related to self-awareness in people who have experienced complex
                    trauma. Only by activating this dormant part of the brain can we begin to truly feel that we are here
                    now, feeling something in the present moment and not reliving a traumatic event from the past.
                </p>

                    In recent years, Trauma Sensitive Yoga has emerged as an effective adjunctive treatment for trauma
                    survivors because it naturally builds interoception – or the ability to sense how something feels in our
                    body. The practice of yoga incorporates a combination of yoga poses, mindfulness and breathing
                    techniques to cultivate a connection to our feeling body. When we move mindfully from yoga pose to yoga
                    pose and focus our attention on our breath and sensations that occur in our body, we begin to notice the
                    connection between our body and our emotions. For example, when we hold a pose for more than a few
                    breaths, we may notice sensation start to build in our legs. We then investigate how focusing on our
                    exhalation breath can produce a sense of calm, or maybe we will feel more ease if we shift the position
                    of our feet. We also notice how sensations have a beginning, a peak, and an end. Knowing that sensations
                    come to an end can expand our capacity for dealing with physical and emotional distress. Noticing and
                    tolerating inner experiences in the present moment begins the process of reclaiming the body and
                    building resilience – helping us to develop a new relationship with our inner sensory world.

                    In a Trauma Sensitive Yoga class, you will be encouraged to practice making empowering choices with your
                    body based on what you are feeling in the present moment – helping you to explore and connect to your
                    body in a safe supportive environment. The language used in a Trauma Sensitive Yoga class is grounded in
                    an empathetic understanding of the physical, psychological, and emotional effects of trauma. The goal is
                    to connect to the somatic body, and then navigate from that entry point to compassionately addressing
                    the emotions and the cognitions that arise as a result. The yoga poses we move through may help to
                    release physical tension and trapped psychological energy, whilst focusing on natural breathing to help
                    promote relaxation, mindfulness, and embodiment. By incorporating the mind, the body and the spirit into
                    treatment, we’re offered an opportunity to heal using our innate resources.

                            <p class="text-brown">Trauma Sensitive Yoga is best used with people who experience
                                treatment-persistent PTSD, or complex trauma, or developmental trauma. Trauma Sensitive Yoga
                                is accessible to everyone. No yoga experience is required. And despite the common
                                misconception that you need to be flexible to practice yoga, Trauma Sensitive Yoga can help
                                people who have limited mobility, as well as people who are active.</p>

                            <p class="text-brown">Full sessions last about 50 – 60 minutes. However, before proceeding we’ll
                                meet for an exploratory session of approximately 20 minutes on Zoom, to get to know each
                                other. I’ll aim to find out what’s motivating you and determine if my guidance is
                                appropriate for your situation. You’ll also have the chance to see if you feel comfortable
                                with me. There’s no obligation, and no costs involved with this initial meeting, so if there
                                doesn’t seem to be a match, then you’ve lost nothing finding out.</p>

                            <p class="text-brown">A Trauma Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY) class differs from a regular yoga class.
                                For example, there never is physical guidance, the facilitator stays on her mat during the
                                lesson and practices together with the participants.</p>
                            <p class="text-brown">In TCTSY, attention is for learning to notice sensations in your body,
                                feeling your own body from within. Participants are invited and encouraged to feel these
                                sensations and actively make choices based on them. TCTSY's vision is to create a safe place
                                for experiences in the moment. With the aim of increasingly experiencing your body as safe
                                and predictable and thereby encountering yourself and others.</p>
